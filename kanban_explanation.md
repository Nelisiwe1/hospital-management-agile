# Kanban Board Explanation

## 1. What is a Kanban Board?
A Kanban board is a visual tool that tracks tasks through different workflow stages using columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

## 2. How Our Kanban Board Works
- **Visualizing Workflow**: Tasks move across columns representing different progress stages.
- **Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)**: We limit WIP to 3 tasks per column to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Supporting Agile Principles**: The board allows continuous iteration, task prioritization, and real-time collaboration.

## 3. Customizations
- Added a **"Testing"** column to align with QA processes.
- Added a **"Blocked"** column to highlight stalled tasks.
- Integrated GitHub Issues with labels (`bug`, `feature`) for better tracking.
